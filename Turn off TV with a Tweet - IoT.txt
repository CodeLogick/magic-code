This post is about using IoT to control things at home from anywhere. I have tried this small project at home where i was able to turn my TV off with the help of a tweet. so , i wanted to share this .

 

Before we go ahead, i would like to explain 2 things which are IoT and Raspberry Pi.

 

Internet of Things [IoT] is a network or mesh of devices talking or interacting with each other without the need for human intervention. The device here can be your home appliance like TV, Refrigerator or 

a Motor in an agricultural farm or even a Pacemaker implanted in your heart sending some data to the doctor's mobile app.

 

Raspberry Pi is a single circuit-board computer that can be used in IoT space, you can buy it for 2000/-. It is like a Mini computer with low resources [ RAM , CPU or Disk Space] .

When you buy a Raspberry Pi, first thing you gotta do is install an OS like Raspbian on it. Raspbian is an  Debian Linux based OS meant for Raspberry Pi.  This OS comes pre-installed

with software like Python, Java etc

 

Enough with the theory..........

 

Let's discuss the hardware/setup that is required for our use-case.

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

1. TV

2. Raspberry Pi

3. HDMI Cable

.

 

 



 

The TV and the Raspberry Pi are connected with the HDMI Cable.

 

Let's look at the flow:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>

It starts with sending a tweet from your Twitter App. There is a Tweet Listener API  (python process running continuously) running on the Raspberry Pi looking at the tweets to see if they contain a specific status/text , for example in this case ,it is "TurnOffTV".

Once the Listener finds this particular status text in the tweet, it sends a TV Off signal with the help of HDMI CEC API.

 

HDMI Standard has a feature or API called CEC (Consumer Electronics Control) which can be used to send commands to a TV. The commands can be invoked on the Linux shell with a CLI utility called cec-client.

For example, the following commands can be invoked from Raspberry Pi's Linux shell or even from a Linux shell on your laptop:

 

echo "on 0" | cec-client -s   // this turns on the TV

echo "standby 0" | cec-client -s    // this turns off the TV

 

we will be using the second command for our use-case which is to turn off the TV.

 

Note :Raspberry Pi is WiFi-enabled and will connect to your home router through WiFi to connect to Internet.

 

 

Shown below is the flow diagram:

>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>



 

 

Shown below is the code to read a tweet from Twitter API and if the tweet contains a text called "TurnOffTV", it sends a signal to the TV using the HDMI API to turn off the TV.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I am using an Python API called Twython  to read tweets from Twitter.

This code runs on your Raspberry Pi Device listening for Tweets.

 

from twython import TwythonStreamer

class MyStreamer(TwythonStreamer):

    def on_success(self, data):

        echo "standby 0" | cec-client -s    //send cec command to the TV to turn off

 

 

//create an object of the streamer class

stream = MyStreamer(APP_KEY, APP_SECRET,OAUTH_TOKEN, OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET)  // these keys can be got from Twitter portal once you create a developer account in Twitter.

stream.statuses.filter(track='TurnOffTV')  //every time my tweet contains this text, on_success method is called

 

 

Note : A similar use-case to turn on the TV can also be done with the above setup and a small change in the code.
